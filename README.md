## Structure

### 1. Math Fundamentals (`1_math/`)
- Math functions, derivatives, vectors, and gradients
- Matrix operations and linear algebra
- Probability and statistics

### 2. PyTorch Basics (`2_pytorch/`)
- Creating and manipulating tensors
- Matrix multiplication, transposing, and reshaping
- Indexing, slicing, and concatenating tensors
- Special tensor creation functions

### 3. Neural Networks (`3_neural_networks/`)
- Building neurons, layers, and networks from scratch

- Activation functions
- Optimizers (Adam, Muon) and learning rate decay

## Requirements

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
